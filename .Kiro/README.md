# Superpowers for Kiro

A complete software development workflow system that transforms your coding agent into a systematic, test-driven development powerhouse.

## Installation

This power is designed to be installed in Kiro's power system. Once installed, all steering files will be automatically loaded and the skills will activate based on context.

**How to Install:**

1. Head over to Kiro Powers panel
2. Click "Add Custom Power"
3. Select "Import power from a folder"
4. Navigate to where you cloned or downloaded this repository
5. **Important**: Select the `Superpower` folder located under `.Kiro`
   - Example Windows: `C:\superpowers\.Kiro\Superpower`
   - Example macOS: `/Users/yourname/superpowers/.Kiro/Superpower`
   - Example Linux: `/home/yourname/superpowers/.Kiro/Superpower`

**⚠️ Common Mistake**: Do not select the repository root or the `.Kiro` folder itself. You must select the `Superpower` subfolder that contains the `POWER.md` file and `steering/` directory.

See [INSTALL.md](Superpower/INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting.

## What You Get

### Automatic Workflow Skills
- **brainstorming** - Interactive design refinement before coding
- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans with exact steps  
- **subagent-driven-development** - Fresh subagents per task with quality reviews
- **test-driven-development** - Strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforcement

### Quality & Debugging
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause analysis
- **code-review** - Two-stage review process (spec compliance + code quality)
- **git-worktrees** - Isolated development workspaces

### Getting Started
- **getting-started** - Complete introduction and examples

## How It Works

1. **Describe what you want to build** - Just tell the agent your idea
2. **Skills activate automatically** - No commands needed, context-driven
3. **Systematic progression** - Each skill hands off to the next
4. **Quality enforcement** - Multiple review stages ensure high quality
5. **Professional workflows** - Git branching, TDD, proper documentation

## Example Usage

```
You: "I want to build a REST API for managing tasks"

Agent: [brainstorming skill activates automatically]
"Let me understand what you're building. What kind of tasks will this manage?"
[continues with systematic requirements gathering]

Agent: [presents design in reviewable sections]
"Here's the API design so far..."

Agent: [creates git worktree for isolated development]
Agent: [writes detailed implementation plan]
Agent: [executes with subagents using TDD]
```

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc**: Process over guessing
- **YAGNI**: Build only what's needed
- **DRY**: Eliminate duplication
- **Quality gates**: Multiple review stages
